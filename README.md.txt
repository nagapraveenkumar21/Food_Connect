This project leverages Salesforce to efficiently manage and coordinate the supply of leftover food from various sources, such as restaurants, events, and households, to people in need. Using Salesforceâ€™s robust CRM capabilities, the project integrates donor registration, food collection tracking, and delivery logistics to ensure a streamlined process. The system automates notifications, tracks food donations in real-time, and connects with local NGOs and volunteers for quick distribution. This initiative helps reduce food waste and addresses hunger, creating a positive social impact by supporting vulnerable communities.
